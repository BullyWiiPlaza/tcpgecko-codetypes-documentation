# TCP Gecko Codetypes Documentation

This is a codetypes documentation website for [CosmoCortney's Nintendo Wii U cafe codetypes codehandler](https://github.com/CosmoCortney/PPC-Cheat-Code-Handler). The code handler is implemented and usable via the [`TCP Gecko Installer`](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/tcpgecko).

Cafe codes can be developed and applied with [`JGecko U`](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/JGeckoU).

## Contributing

You are encouraged to submit improvements or additions to the codetypes documentation website by sending a pull request. Opening an issue if you cannot make the improvement/change yourself is okay, too.

## Hosting

This is a web project so you can host it easily on any web server by copying all files into the web server and linking to the `codetypes_EN.html` page.
