# TCP Gecko Codetypes Documentation

This is a codetypes documentation website for CosmoCortney's Nintendo Wii U cafe codetypes codehandler. The code handler is implemented in the `TCP Gecko Installer`.

Cafe codes can be developed and applied with [`JGecko U`](https://github.com/BullyWiiPlaza/JGeckoU).

## Contributing

You are encouraged to submit improvements or additions to the codetypes documentation by sending a pull request. Opening an issue if you cannot make the improvement/change yourself is okay, too.

## Hosting

This is a web project so you can host it easily on any web server by copying all files into the web server and linking to the `codetypes_EN.html` page.
